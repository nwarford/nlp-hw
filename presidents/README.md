Who was President When?
=======================

To get us warmed up, we're going to practice using a knowledge base (the dates
of US presidents in office) and string manipulation.  We'll also get used to
Gradescope and its leaderboard functionality.  More importantly, this code
will introduce some of the object-oriented structure of future projects.

This homework is meant to be very easy.  You should not need to spend a lot of
time on this.

However, like many of our homework assignments, there will be opportunity for
extra credit.

What you have to do
===================

The PresidentGuesser (in `president_guesser.py`) takes a question and
returns a guess of who the president was.  You need to extract what
time the question is asking about and return the name of the
appropriate US president.

There are two things you need to do: store the appropriate information
in the `train` function and then retrieve it in the `__call__` function.

This should be very simple, no more than five lines of code.  If you're
writing far more than that, you're likely not taking advantage of built-in
Python libraries that you should be using.

What's "Good Enough"?
====================================

This homework will also introduce you to the "Good Enough" goals of an
assignment.  If you do this, you'll get an A.  You won't necessarily get all
of the possible points and certainly not the extra credit, but if you do this
much, you can certainly stop stressing about the assignment.  

For each homework, we'll outline what the "Good Enough" goals are;
this is important because most of the homeworks are fairly open-ended.
It's important for you to know when it's okay to call it a day.

For this homework, just list the correct presidents given the year and
return all possible presidents in a list.  We've made it easy for you
do do that:

    def __call__(self, question, n_guesses=1):
        # Update this code so that we can have a different president than Joe
        # Biden
        candidates = ["Joseph R. Biden"]

        if len(candidates) == 0:
            return [{"guess": ""}]
        else:
            return [{"guess": x} for x in candidates]

Just fill in all of the possible presidents given that year in the
`candidates` list and return them.  For many of our homeworks, getting
the right answer somewhere in the list of top results is more
important than just getting *the one* answer.

How do I know if my code is working?
====================================

For most of your homeworks, there will be two ways to test your code:
unit tests and `eval.py`.  For this homework, the feedback is exactly
the same, but for future homeworks, they will provide different
information.

Let's start with the unit tests first.  When you run them, you should
see something like this:

     jbg@MacBook-Pro-von-Jordan presidents % python3 president_test.py
     F
     ======================================================================
     FAIL: test_basic (__main__.TestPresidentGuessers.test_basic)
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "/Users/jbg/repositories/nlp-hw/presidents/president_test.py", line 13, in test_basic
         self.assertEqual(guess, ii["page"])
     AssertionError: 'Joseph R. Biden' != 'Ronald Reagan'
     - Joseph R. Biden
     + Ronald Reagan
      : Wrong answer for: Who was president on Sat May 23 02:00:00 1982?

     ----------------------------------------------------------------------
     Ran 1 test in 0.000s

The starter code will always return that Joe Biden is the president,
and it got the answer wrong for May 23, 1982.  As you fix those
issues, it will only show the first test that you fail, so eventually
it will say that all tests pass.

But unit tests aren't really the best tests, so you should also run
the eval script.  If you've met the "good enough" goals, you should
get a result that looks like this:

    jbg@MacBook-Pro-von-Jordan GPT3QA % python3 eval.py --evaluate=guesser --guesser_type='President' --questions=presidents --question_source='toy'

    Precision @1: 0.5556 Recall: 1.0000
    
We'll talk about exactly what precision and recall mean in future
lectures, but Precision @1 corresponds to how often the right answer
was at the top of your list of results and recall is how often the
right answer appeared in that list.  

It should be possible to get 1.0 Precision@1 for this homework (but
nott in future homeworks).  But again, this is not required for a
"Good Enough" submission.

How to turn it in
=================

Modify `president_guesser.py` and upload it HW0 on Gradescope.  Do not
modify any other files.

What's all this other code?
==========================

We'll slowly build up a more complicated system for answering
questions over the course of the semester and we'll build on the code
that's here.  You don't need to know how all the code works, but it
might be helpful to look it over, as you're going to be implicitly
using it.

* `guesser.py`: The base class for the Guesser you're implementing,
  it's defining the interface for where a question comes in and how
  the guesses come out.
  
* `params.py`: We'll be calling our code from the command line using
  [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html#module-argparse).
  This code loads the data and code as specified from the command
  line.  You can see that the `instantiate_guesser` function creates a
  PresidentGuesser object for you.
  
* `eval.py`: Evaluates your code to see how well it's working.

We'll be adding more code as the semester goes on.

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

**Q: I'm getting an error message saying that `foobar` cannot be
imported.  What do I do?**

**A**: Create a virtual environment to [install the
packages](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/).

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

**Q: What time formats do we need to deal with?**

**A**: All of the all of the questions will be formatted as `Day Mon DD
  HH:MM:SS YYYY`.  Look at the unit tests for examples.

**Q: Can I change the training data or the logic in loading the training
  data?**

**A**: You may, but you shouldn't need to do this for anything but the extra
  credit.

**Q: I've done the homework, passing the tests, but I'm not getting a perfect
  score on the leaderboard.  How do I do better to get extra credit?**

**A**: The whole point of extra credit is to be fun / challenging.  Consider
  assumptions and limitations of the template code.

**Q: When does a president's term start?**

**A:** The twentieth amendment states that the term of each elected President
  of the United States begins at noon on January 20.  Before that, we assume
  it started at noon on the day they were innaugurated.

**Q: Okay, I'm doing better, but I'm still not perfect.**

**A:**: Some of the tests are indeed trickier.

**Q: Is there some president that's not in the provided training data?**

**A:**: All of the possible presidents are listed there.  

**Q: In 1849, who was president the evening of March 4 1849 and the morning of
  March 5?**

**A:** It is tempting to say [David Rice
  Atchison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/David_Rice_Atchison), but most
  constitutional scholars believe that Zachary Taylor was nonetheless
  president despite not taking the oath on Sunday.

Points Possible
===============

You get full credit for matching the baseline accuracy (85%) and can get up to
three points for improving significantly beyond that.
